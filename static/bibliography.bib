  abstract      = {As machine learning increasingly affects people and society, it is important that we strive for a comprehensive and unified understanding of potential sources of unwanted consequences. For instance, downstream harms to particular groups are often blamed on "biased data," but this concept encompass too many issues to be useful in developing solutions. In this paper, we provide a framework that partitions sources of downstream harm in machine learning into six distinct categories spanning the data generation and machine learning pipeline. We describe how these issues arise, how they are relevant to particular applications, and how they motivate different solutions. In doing so, we aim to facilitate the development of solutions that stem from an understanding of application-specific populations and data generation processes, rather than relying on general statements about what may or may not be "fair."},
